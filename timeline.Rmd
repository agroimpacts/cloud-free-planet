## Project Timeline

For Summer 2018. Hover over items to see people assigned. Scroll up or down over areas in timeline on which you wish to zoom in or out.

Tasks are grouped by rough categories in the left hand column. 

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width=9}
library(readxl)
library(timevis)
timelines <- read_excel("timelines.xlsx")

grps <- unique(timelines$group)
timevis(data = timelines, 
        groups = data.frame(id = grps, content = grps))

```
