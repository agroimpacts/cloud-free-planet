To restore the entire Africa database:

NOTE: If updating ***REMOVED*** to a later version, modify the steps below to
follow the procedure described at this link:
http://***REMOVED***.net/docs/***REMOVED***_installation.html#hard_upgrade

1) As root, copy the local pg_hba.conf to /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data.
   NOTE: Make sure ownership is postgres:postgres and permissions are 600.
   Comment all 'all postgres md5' lines and uncomment all 'all all trust' lines.
2) As root, run 'service postgresql-9.4 start'.
3) Change the PostgreSQL postgres password, and create the ***REMOVED*** role as superuser:
    psql -U postgres
    \i role_create_su.sql
4) As root, edit /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/pg_hba.conf, and uncomment all 
   'all postgres md5' lines and comment all 'all all trust' lines.
5) Edit /var/lib/pgsql/9.4/data/postgresql.conf, uncomment the 'listen_addresses'
   line, and change 'localhost' to '*'.
6) As root, run 'service postgresql-9.4 restart'.

7) As superuser ***REMOVED***, create the desired (e.g., Africa or AfricaSandbox) database 
   and schema by running the restore script:
   (NOTE: logging into Postgresql as superuser ***REMOVED*** to do this ensures that 
    all ***REMOVED*** extension objects are owned by ***REMOVED***.)
   /u/mapper/afmap/pgsql/restoreRenamedDbFromBackup.sh
     or
   /u/sandbox/afmap/pgsql/restoreRenamedDbFromBackup.sh
   NOTE: This script will restore ***REMOVED*** to be a regular DB user (not a superuser).

8) To configure daily database backups:

a) As root, execute:
crontab /u/sandbox|mapper/afmap/pgsql/crontabSetup.root

b) Set permissions to 600 for /u/sandbox/afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_* and 
   /u/mapper/afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_* .

c) For ease of execution of DB scripts, as users sandbox and mapper, copy 
   /u/sandbox/afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_sandbox and /u/mapper/afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_mapper 
   (respectively) to ~/.pgpass .
