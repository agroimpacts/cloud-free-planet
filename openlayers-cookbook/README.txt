= OpenLayers Cookbook =

Author: Antonio Santiago

== Requirements ==

To run the code samples of the book you need HTTP server with PHP support. 
PHP is only required for some recipes, so you can run many of them on a server 
without PHP support.

== How to run the saples ==

Copy the project folder within your HTTP server and open the 'index.html' file,
for example, accessing: http://localhost:8080/openlayers-cookbook/index.html.

We have prepared an application with a main menu on top, where user can 
choose and run the desired recipe. 

Each recipe will be openen in a new tab, where user will see two subtabs, first with
the recipe results and the second with the recipe code.

== Content of the project folder ==

The summary of the project folder is:

\css - CSS files for the user interface.

\defs - Projection definitions from the Proj4js project required on some recipes of the book.

\js - Contains code for the libraries the project depends on.

\js\OpenLayers-2.11 - OpenLayers library version 2.11. The book samples has coded with
                          this version, so here is the same version. Maybe some things can be changes
                          or deprecated in future version, so it is better to have the exact version here.

\js\dojo-release-1.7.2 - The main application and some recipes used components (like tabs, button,
                         sliders, etc) from this projects. Here is the code for the version used.

\js\proj4js-1.1.0 - Proj4js project code. OpenLayers depends on this project for some operations.

         folder is helpful for those user that wants to edit book samples on NetBeans.

Important
--------------------------------------
The receipes contain absolute URLs to the images the user desires to use. In this sample, the images are located at "http://localhost:8080/...".
The users need to modify the URL to point to the appropriate site, as per the port they are using.
