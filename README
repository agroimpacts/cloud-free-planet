1) To get webob v1.2+ to be in Python's path, add a webob.pth file to the /usr/lib/<python>/site-packages directory with the name of the webob egg directory in it.

2) To easily access pgadmin3 v9.4, create /etc/profile.d/postgresql.[c]sh containing:
tcsh:
setenv PATH "/usr/pgsql-9.4/bin:$PATH"
bash:
export PATH="/usr/pgsql-9.4/bin:$PATH"

3) For ease of execution of scripts, copy .../afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_sandbox or .../afmap/pgsql/pgpassfile_mapper (as appropriate) to ~/.pgpass . Ensure that permissions are set to 600 for these files.

4) Add Apache http/https WSGI configurations for sandbox and mapper virtual hosts:
see configuration file examples in the .../afmap/apache subdirectory.

5) Merge changes from the afmap/etc/aliases file into the system's aliases file.

6) Add the following lines to .bashrc for sandbox and mapper users:
a) For sandbox user:
export PYTHONPATH="/u/sandbox/afmap/mturk"
umask 0007
b) For mapper user:
export PYTHONPATH="/u/mapper/afmap/mturk"
umask 0007
NOTE: This allows MTurkMappingAfrica.py to be imported from scripts running in 
      other than the .../afmap/mturk directory, during an *interactive* session.
      Cron daemons always need to run from the .../afmap/mturk directory
      because crontab ignores the .bashrc settings.
