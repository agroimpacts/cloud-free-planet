# mapper

The crowdsourcing platform for the active learning framework, as adapted from the original version designed to operate with Amazon's Mechanical Turk. 

## Overview

Documentation is in the process of being updated. Here are a few pointers to some of it. 

- [A look](docs/project-tasks.md) at what needs to be done in the project and how `mapper` fits into it. 

- A description of [mapper's components](docs/mapper-design.md), as originally designed (needs to be updated to reflect changes).

- A description of `mapper`'s [database](docs/database.md).

- How `mapper` and `cvml` [interact](docs/) in the active learning process. 

- Image acquisition is currently provided by a [Planet downloader client](spatial/planet/README.md).
