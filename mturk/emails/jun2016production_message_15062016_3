Changes to "no image" HIT 

Dear workers,

We are still in the progress of resolving this issue, but we'd like to make a minor change regarding the best action to take when encountering this HIT that displays "Sorry, we have no imagery here." Please comment "no image" and then return (instead of saving it). We have also updated our FAQ to reflect this change: http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu/blog.html#!/blog/posts/Frequently-Asked-Questions/6.

Thank you for your patience.
