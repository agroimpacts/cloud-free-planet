We are back online!

Dear Mechanical Turk workers,

We have brought our "daemons" that generate HITs back up, which means that we are back online and running. Again, thank you for your suggestions and comments yesterday; we are taking them into consideration and making adjustments. Thank you all for your work yesterday! We look forward to working with you today.

Best,

The Mapping Africa Team
