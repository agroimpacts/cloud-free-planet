Dear Workers,

You may have noticed that we are no longer generating new HITs. Thanks to everyone's hard work, our project has essentially completed our goal number of sites to map for now. Some sites are still outstanding, and have not yet been mapped (because of abandonment, etc).  Once we have accounted for these, we will create as many new HITs as needed to totally complete our target area. 

We really appreciate everyone's patience, hard work, and feedback during this project. Your mapping has really been terrific, and has provided us with the data we need to conduct the next round of system improvements. Thank you!

Sincerely,
the Mapping Africa Team
