Welcome, and quick note about our mapping HITs

Dear Mechanical Turk worker, 

Thanks for taking our qualification test, and for mapping HITs for us. Now that you are mapping, I just wanted to send a quick note to you.  First, please refer to the project website, and specifically the FAQ, for some answers to questions, and to refresh yourself about mapping rules.

I want to highlight one aspect of our scoring, which is: 

"Because we are trying to develop an unbiased map of cropland, we discourage returns in our calculation of quality score, which determines both the maintenance of qualifications and bonus payments. We deduct the proportion of returns from the quality score in even 10 HITs, so if this proportion gets high, then it can prevent bonus payments and even cause loss of qualifications."  

Please keep this in mind as you map, and thanks again for joining us!

Best regards, the Mapping Africa team
