About your comment on a HIT

Dear Mechanical Turk worker,

We noticed the following comment on one of your HITs.
"Is there a way we could have a tip sheet or examples available as reference? I want to make sure everything is marked correctly so a quick guide to remind us of the Qualification video tips would be very useful. Thanks!"

We have posted a link to our tutorial video under the FAQ on our website: http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu/blog.html#!/blog/posts/Frequently-Asked-Questions/6.

Best,

the Mapping Africa team
