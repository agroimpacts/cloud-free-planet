End of day, 15 June 2016 

Dear Workers,

Thank you very much for your continued mapping efforts today. You have mapped a great deal more area during the course of the day, with over 1100 assignments completed!

During the course of the day we have made some adjustments. We have lowered the assignment acceptance threshold in order to greatly minimize the number of rejections, as we realize that interpreting the maps can be challenging and we don't want to damage workers' reputations. Because our goal is to obtain high quality maps, the same qualification standard remains in place.  

We also lowered the quality bonus payment thresholds to better match the distribution of scores that have been returned. More of you should start to receive this additional bonuses now.  

As with last night, we will turn off the HIT creation daemon overnight to guard against possible malfunctions occurring. Those HITs that have already been generated will remain available for mapping, and we will start generating new HITs in the morning.  

Thanks again for all your efforts!
