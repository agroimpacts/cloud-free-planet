New HITs on pause through weekend

Dear Workers, 

We stopped generating new HITs this morning to do some housekeeping and to check on a few potential bugs. We will start generating new HITs when we have finished this, which will hopefully be on Monday.  Your qualifications will remain valid. 

Please check the status message at the top of the FAQ for updates:

Thanks very much for your continued efforts and interest!

Thanks, the Mapping Africa Team

p.s. Apologies if this is the second time you are receiving--not everyone received it the first time around.
