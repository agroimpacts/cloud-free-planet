Shutting down for the night, end of day message

Dear Workers, 

Many thanks for all your efforts today, and for your suggestions. This is the first 24 hours the system has been live since we relaunched. We are going to take the system offline for the night (~11.40 pm Eastern Standard Time), because we don't have 24 hours human monitoring of the system, and want to make sure that nothing goes wrong while we are asleep. What this means is that we are shutting down the "daemons" that create new HITs to replace ones that you have mapped.  That means that the number of HITs on the system will run down until all or most are completed.  We will restart our HIT generator at the start of the business day tomorrow when we are up and about and able to monitor.  Tomorrow we will hopefully have a better sense of system stability, and made any necessary changes, so that we can leave the system running through the night. 

Thanks to all of you have been diligently mapping, and for your helpful feedback. We look forward to continue working with you!
