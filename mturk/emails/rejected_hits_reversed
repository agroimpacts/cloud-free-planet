Mapping Africa: incorrectly rejected HITs have been reversed

Dear Mechanical Turk worker,

As mentioned in our previous email to you, we have now approved the HITs that had been incorrectly rejected, and you should see these payments appear in your account shortly along with a relevant feedback message.  As well, your approval rate has been restored to what it would have been had this error not occurred.

We are still working on your submitted HITs that are pending approval, which we plan to approve over the next few days.

Again, we thank you for helping us with the Mapping Africa project to date, and hope that you will continue to assist us when we go live again.

Best regards,
             The Mapping Africa team
