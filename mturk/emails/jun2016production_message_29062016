Mapping Africa is up and running!

Dear Workers,

We offer our apologies for the delay in getting Mapping Africa running again. We heard back from Amazon about a technical issue earlier today, and we are now creating new HITs. 

We have also added more examples to our website. Please see #13 on our FAQ: http://mappingafrica.princeton.edu/blog.html#!/blog/posts/Frequently-Asked-Questions/6.

Thank you so much for your patience and interest. We look forward to working with you again!

Best,

the Mapping Africa Team
