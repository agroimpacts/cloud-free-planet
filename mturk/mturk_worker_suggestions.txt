Suggestions by Mechanical Turk workers

1. Map with two colors, one for fields that the worker is sure about being cropland, and another for fields that the worker is unsure about but thinks is cropland.
2. Have the mapping platform begin with the mapping tool already selected, instead of having to select it first every single time.
3. Instead of rejection, take away the bonus instead.
